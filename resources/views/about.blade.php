            The Centre for Community Engagement and Work Integrated Learning was established as an institutional response to the 1991 Education White Paper on the transformation of higher education which calls for all South African higher education institutions to demonstrate greater responsibility and commitment to the socio-economic development of communities. In line with this mandate, the centre seeks to strengthen CPUTâ€™s partnerships with industry, private organizations and the community in order to create an environment for the application of knowledge and production of well grounded and socially responsive graduates.

            CPUT defines community engagement as those activities and programs offered by the institution which involve collaborative interaction with individuals, groups, and organizations external to CPUT at the local, regional, national and international levels to achieve economic and social objectives using engaged teaching and learning initiatives, volunteerism, research and various forms of work-integrated learning, such as service learning and cooperative education.
